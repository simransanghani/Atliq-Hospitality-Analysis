## Key Insights
**Lack of Pricing Strategy**  
Issue: No dynamic or weekday/weekend pricing is implemented.  
Impact: Missed revenue optimization opportunities during peak and off-peak periods.  
Action: Implement revenue management techniques such as dynamic pricing, demand-based rates, and yield management to increase average daily rate (ADR) and overall revenue.  

**Revenue Trends and Losses**   
Issue: Weekly revenue shows fluctuations and notable losses.  
Impact: Inconsistent earnings reduce financial predictability.  
Action: Analyze peak and off-peak periods to stabilize cash flow through promotions, pricing strategy, and better forecasting.  

**Weekend vs. Weekday Performance**  
Issue: RevPAR and occupancy rates are higher on weekends.  
Impact: Underutilized weekday inventory.  
Action: Introduce corporate packages, weekday deals, or long-stay offers to improve weekday performance.  

**Cancellation and No-Show Rates**  
Issue: High cancellation rate of 24.84%.  
Impact: Lost revenue and inventory blocking.  
Action: Introduce stricter cancellation policies, incentives for non-refundable bookings, or predictive overbooking strategies.  

**Customer Experience**   
Issue: Average rating of 3.62.  
Impact: Impacts repeat bookings and online reputation.  
Action: Improve service quality, cleanliness, responsiveness, and staff training to boost satisfaction and conversions.  

**Platform Performance**    
Insight: High bookings and revenue from makeyourtrip.  
Impact: Heavy dependency on OTAs reduces margins.  
Action: Improve direct booking channels through incentives, loyalty programs, or better UX on your website/app.  

**Occupancy and Conversion Rates**   
Insight: Strong performance in Mumbai and Bangalore.  
Impact: Localized strength can be scaled or replicated in other regions.  
Action: Use insights from high-performing cities to boost conversion in underperforming areas.

Insight: Elite and Premium rooms generate most revenue.  
Impact: Indicates success of high-margin segments.  
Action: Upsell room classes, bundle amenities, and target premium customers.
